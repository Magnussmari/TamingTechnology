## 📅 Research Workflow Goals

### Ideal Future Workflow (AI-Augmented)

**In 3 months, my research process should look like:**

**Morning routine:**
```
[e.g., "AI monitors new publications overnight, presents 5-10 most relevant
to review over coffee, I triage in 30 min"]
```

**Literature review:**
```
[e.g., "AI does initial screening of 100+ papers, I review AI summaries,
deep-read top 20, AI helps synthesize findings into draft review"]
```

**Writing:**
```
[e.g., "AI helps outline based on literature, I write rough draft,
AI helps with clarity and structure, I polish final version"]
```

**Staying current:**
```
[e.g., "Weekly AI digest of new papers in my area, monthly synthesis
of emerging trends"]
```
