# TASK

Based on my research profile and needs above, create a personalized AI-augmented research learning roadmap that:

1. **Assesses My Starting Point**: Acknowledge my current workflow and validate the transition I'm making from manual to AI-augmented research. Identify my biggest pain points that AI can address immediately.

2. **Recommends Research-Specific AI Tools**: Based on my domain, paper volume, and technical comfort, suggest:
   - **Search & Discovery**: Which AI tools for finding papers (Perplexity, Elicit, Consensus, Scite.ai, etc.)
   - **Evaluation & Synthesis**: Which tools for analyzing papers (Claude, ChatGPT, specialized research AI)
   - **Organization**: Citation management integration, note-taking systems
   - **Automation**: Whether scripting makes sense for my needs (and if so, what language/tools)

3. **Builds a Progressive Learning Path**: Structure the roadmap in phases:

   **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**
   - Set up AI Research Workbench (essential tools)
   - Learn basic AI prompting for research
   - Practice on 5-10 papers in my field

   **Phase 2: Core Skills (Week 3-4)**
   - Master literature search with AI
   - Systematic paper evaluation
   - Build evaluation rubrics for my domain
   - Organize findings effectively

   **Phase 3: Advanced Integration (Week 5-6)**
   - Multi-tool orchestration workflows
   - Synthesis and gap identification
   - Writing assistance (if requested)
   - Basic scripting (if applicable)

   **Phase 4: Automation & Mastery (Week 7-8)**
   - Automated monitoring of new publications
   - Custom research workflows
   - Integration with existing tools (Zotero, Notion, etc.)
   - Full research project using AI system

4. **Provides Domain-Specific Guidance**: Tailor recommendations to my field:
   - Which databases/sources to prioritize
   - Domain-specific evaluation criteria
   - Typical research workflows in my area
   - Common pitfalls in my field that AI can help avoid

5. **Includes Milestone Projects**: Define 3-5 specific research tasks to validate progress:
   - Week 2: Process 10 papers on [my topic] using AI, create summary table
   - Week 4: Build paper evaluation rubric for my domain, apply to 20 papers
   - Week 6: Complete mini-literature review (30-50 papers) using full AI workflow
   - Week 8: Set up automated monitoring + synthesis system for my field

6. **Addresses Research Ethics & Quality**: Include guidance on:
   - Verifying AI-generated summaries
   - Avoiding hallucinations in citations
   - Maintaining research rigor
   - When to use AI vs. deep reading
   - Transparency in AI-assisted research

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

**Format**: A personalized research learning roadmap structured as a markdown document with:
- Clear weekly phases
- Specific tool recommendations with rationale
- Step-by-step instructions for each phase
- Milestone validation projects
- Time estimates for each activity

**Tone**: Academic but practical. Respect my research expertise while introducing AI tools. Use field-appropriate language. No condescension.

**Constraints**:
- Focus on tools I actually have access to or can access
- Match recommendations to my technical comfort level
- Don't recommend complex scripting if I said "NO" to programming
- Prioritize tools that integrate with my existing workflow
- Address my specific pain points identified above
- Suggest realistic timeline based on my time availability
- Include both free and paid tool options where relevant
- Length: 800-1200 words depending on complexity of needs

**Special Considerations**:
- If I handle high paper volume (100+), emphasize automation
- If I'm non-technical, focus on no-code AI solutions
- If I'm technical, include scripting opportunities
- Tailor to my domain's norms (citations styles, databases, etc.)
- Account for my deadline pressure (or lack thereof)

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about your field** - "Machine learning in NLP" beats "Computer science"
2. **Honest about technical skills** - Accurate assessment = better tool recommendations
3. **Describe current pain** - Detail what's broken in your workflow
4. **Set clear goals** - Specific outputs ("submit 2 papers") beat vague ("get better")
5. **Note your paper volume** - Drives automation recommendations
6. **Save your output** - Name it `[YourName]_Research_Roadmap_[Date].md`
