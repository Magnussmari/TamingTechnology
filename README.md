**Transform how you learn and build with AI** 🚀

Stop using one AI for everything. Learn to **orchestrate** specialized AI tools like a conductor leading an orchestra—each instrument playing its perfect part.

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

A complete system for **AI-augmented learning and development** that teaches you:

- 🎼 **AI Orchestration** - Conduct multiple specialized AIs (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Cursor) instead of relying on one
- 🗺️ **Personalized Learning** - Generate custom 8-week roadmaps tailored to your exact background and goals
- 🏗️ **Systems Thinking** - Understand technology stacks, architecture, and how pieces connect
- ⚡ **Rapid Skill Acquisition** - Build real projects while learning, not just tutorials

**Perfect for:**
- Developers transitioning from low-code/no-code tools (Lovable, Bolt, Replit, v0)
- Self-taught learners who want structure without traditional courses
- Professionals adding new tech stacks to their toolkit
- Teams establishing AI-augmented workflows

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Choose Your AI Tools
- **Research:** [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai) (free tier works)
- **Strategy:** [Claude Chat](https://claude.ai) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
- **Implementation:** [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) (recommended) or Claude Code

### 2. Create Your Learning Roadmap
1. Open [PROMPTS/prompt-1-roadmap.md](PROMPTS/prompt-1-roadmap.md)
2. Fill in your background, experience, and goals
3. Paste into Perplexity or Claude Chat
4. **You now have a personalized 8-week learning plan!**

### 3. Start Building
Follow your roadmap and use the [Senior-Junior AI Pattern](PROMPTS/prompt-3-senior-junior.md) when coding:
- **Senior AI** (Claude Chat) = Strategic thinking, architecture, debugging
- **Junior AI** (Cursor) = Code implementation, quick fixes
- **You** = The orchestrator who transfers context between them

---

## 🎼 The Core Philosophy: AI Orchestration

**Traditional Approach (Inefficient):**
```
You → ChatGPT → Try to solve everything
         ↓
    Mediocre results
```

**Orchestration Approach (Optimal):**
```
You (Conductor) → Perplexity (Research)
                → Claude Chat (Strategy)
                → Cursor (Implementation)
                → Claude Code (Analysis)
                ↓
    Excellence in each domain
```

### The Three Laws of AI Orchestration
1. **Law of Specialization** - Never ask an AI to do what another AI does better
2. **Law of Context Transfer** - You carry context between AIs, not the AIs themselves
3. **Law of Clear Boundaries** - Each AI gets a specific job, not a vague mission

---

## 🚀 The 3-Prompt System

### 1. Learning Roadmap Generator
**When:** Starting new skills, career transitions, feeling lost
**AI:** Perplexity or Claude Chat
**Output:** Custom 8-week learning plan

### 2. Tech Stack Analysis
**When:** New project, inherited codebase, "WTF is this?"
**AI:** Claude Code or Claude Chat
**Output:** Architecture breakdown, data flow, learning priorities

### 3. Senior-Junior AI Pattern
**When:** Building anything, debugging, code review
**AI:** Claude Chat (Senior) + Cursor (Junior)
**Output:** Structured collaboration with escalation when stuck

---

## 💡 Real-World Example

**Sam's Journey:** Business analyst → Professional developer in 8 weeks

**Week 1-2:** Used Prompt 1 to create roadmap, Prompt 2 to understand existing Lovable project
**Week 3-4:** Built simple features with Cursor, escalated complex bugs to Claude Chat
**Week 5-6:** Designed and built first original features using full orchestration
**Week 7-8:** Built custom CRM feature independently with AI collaboration

**Result:** Confident, capable, understands architecture, knows when to escalate

## 📊 Success Metrics

**You're on track when:**
- ✅ You naturally think "which AI?" before starting tasks
- ✅ Context transfers between AIs are smooth and quick
- ✅ You escalate at the right time (not too early, not too late)
- ✅ Code reading improves—you understand WHY, not just WHAT
- ✅ Tasks that took days now take hours
- ✅ You're building things, not just consuming tutorials
