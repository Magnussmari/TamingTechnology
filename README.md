**Transform how you learn and build with AI** 🚀

Stop using one AI for everything. Learn to **orchestrate** specialized AI tools like a conductor leading an orchestra—each instrument playing its perfect part.

## 📖 About This Project

**This is a work in progress.**

This repository documents my approach to AI—a methodology that has been forming and evolving over the last few years through real-world practice and experimentation. You can see some of my work at [www.smarason.is](https://www.smarason.is).

**This is a starting point, not a rulebook.** Once you get a feel for these tools and patterns, you'll adapt them to do what *you* want—whether that's learning to cook Italian food, managing software projects, conducting research, or something entirely different.

**The most important thing:** How does this technology make your life in the real world better? That's the question that matters.

Technology for technology's sake is just noise. Technology that helps you build, create, learn, and solve real problems—that's worth your time.

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

A complete system for **AI-augmented learning and work** that teaches you to orchestrate multiple specialized AIs like a conductor leading an orchestra.

**Core Philosophy:**
- 🎼 **AI Orchestration** - Conduct multiple specialized AIs (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Cursor) instead of relying on one
- 🗺️ **Personalized Learning Paths** - Generate custom roadmaps tailored to your exact background and goals
- 🏗️ **Systems Thinking** - Understand complete systems, architecture, and how pieces connect
- ⚡ **Build While Learning** - Real projects, not just tutorials

**Timeline:** Varies by background and goals. Some see results in weeks, others need months. Your mileage will vary.

## 🛤️ Choose Your Pathway

**Same foundation, different applications:**

### 💻 [Development Pathway](PROMPTS/) (Main)
**For software developers and engineers**

Build applications, understand codebases, learn programming:
- Transition from low-code/no-code tools to professional development
- Master tech stacks (React, Next.js, Python, etc.)
- Build with AI collaboration (Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot)
- Deploy production applications

**Perfect for:**
- Developers transitioning from Lovable, Bolt, Replit, v0
- Self-taught learners wanting structure
- Professionals adding new tech stacks
- Teams establishing AI-augmented development

**[→ Start Development Pathway](#-quick-start-15-minutes)**

---

### 🔬 [Research Pathway](RESEARCH-PATHWAY/) **NEW!**
**For academic researchers and scientists**

Automate literature reviews, systematic research, and evidence synthesis:
- Process 100+ papers systematically (not manually)
- Use AI for search, evaluation, and synthesis
- Build research workflows with Scite.ai, Elicit, Claude
- Create custom evaluation rubrics for your field

**Perfect for:**
- PhD students doing literature reviews
- Researchers doing systematic reviews or meta-analyses
- Scientists monitoring emerging research
- Academics writing grants and papers

**[→ Start Research Pathway](RESEARCH-PATHWAY/)**

---

Both pathways start with the same [USER-PROFILE](USER-PROFILE.md), then diverge based on your goals.

### 3. Start Building (2 min setup)
Follow your roadmap and use the [Senior-Junior AI Pattern](PROMPTS/prompt-3-senior-junior.md) when coding:
- **Senior AI** (Claude Chat) = Strategic thinking, architecture, debugging
- **Junior AI** (Cursor) = Code implementation, quick fixes
- **You** = The orchestrator who transfers context between them

---

## 🎼 The Core Philosophy: AI Orchestration

**Traditional Approach (Inefficient):**
```
You → ChatGPT → Try to solve everything
         ↓
    Mediocre results
```

**Orchestration Approach (Optimal):**
```
You (Conductor) → Perplexity (Research)
                → Claude Chat (Strategy)
                → Cursor (Implementation)
                → Claude Code (Analysis)
                ↓
    Excellence in each domain
```

### The Three Laws of AI Orchestration
1. **Law of Specialization** - Never ask an AI to do what another AI does better
2. **Law of Context Transfer** - You carry context between AIs, not the AIs themselves
3. **Law of Clear Boundaries** - Each AI gets a specific job, not a vague mission

---

## 🚀 The 3-Prompt System

### 1. Learning Roadmap Generator
**When:** Starting new skills, career transitions, feeling lost
**AI:** Perplexity or Claude Chat
**Output:** Custom structured learning roadmap

### 2. Tech Stack Analysis
**When:** New project, inherited codebase, "WTF is this?"
**AI:** Claude Code or Claude Chat
**Output:** Architecture breakdown, data flow, learning priorities

### 3. Senior-Junior AI Pattern
**When:** Building anything, debugging, code review
**AI:** Claude Chat (Senior) + Cursor (Junior)
**Output:** Structured collaboration with escalation when stuck

## 💭 What Success Looks Like

Success isn't about speed—it's about sustainable progress and building real capability.

### Early Wins (First Few Weeks)
- You understand *why* the AI suggested that approach
- You can spot when AI gives you outdated or wrong advice
- You've built something small but complete
- You know which tool to reach for

### Building Momentum (1-3 Months)
- Reading code feels less like reading hieroglyphics
- You can debug simple issues without AI
- You're building things that actually work
- You understand architecture, not just syntax

### Sustainable Productivity (3-6+ Months)
- AI is your co-pilot, not your autopilot
- You're shipping features consistently
- You help others who are earlier in the journey
- You understand your own learning style

**The Real Metric:** Can you build things that work and maintain them over time?

Time to get there varies wildly based on:
- Prior technical experience
- Time commitment (part-time vs. full-time)
- Complexity of your goals
- Your learning style and persistence

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**You're on track when:**
- ✅ You naturally think "which AI?" before starting tasks
- ✅ Context transfers between AIs are smooth and quick
- ✅ You escalate at the right time (not too early, not too late)
- ✅ Code reading improves—you understand WHY, not just WHAT
- ✅ Tasks that took days now take hours
- ✅ You're building things, not just consuming tutorials

---

## 🎼 The Bottom Line

You're not just learning to code. You're learning to orchestrate intelligence—both artificial and your own—to achieve goals that were previously out of reach.

**This isn't magic. It's method.**

The system works. But *you* have to do the work.

You have an entire orchestra of AI tools ready to help. You're the conductor.

**Now go build something.** 🎻🎺🎸🥁🎹

Start small. Build consistently. Progress compounds.
