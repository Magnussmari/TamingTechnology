**Transform how you learn and build with AI** 🚀

Stop using one AI for everything. Learn to **orchestrate** specialized AI tools like a conductor leading an orchestra—each instrument playing its perfect part.

---

## 📖 What Is This Repository?

**This is a work in progress** documenting a practical methodology for AI-augmented learning and work.

This repository captures my approach to AI—a methodology that's been forming and evolving over the last few years through real-world practice and experimentation. You can see some of my work at [www.smarason.is](https://www.smarason.is).

**This is a starting point, not a rulebook.** Once you get a feel for these tools and patterns, you'll adapt them to do what *you* want—whether that's learning to cook Italian food, managing software projects, conducting research, or something entirely different.

**The most important question:** How does this technology make your life in the real world better?

Technology for technology's sake is just noise. Technology that helps you build, create, learn, and solve real problems—that's worth your time.

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

A complete system for **AI-augmented learning and work** that teaches you to orchestrate multiple specialized AIs like a conductor leading an orchestra.

**Core Philosophy:**
- 🎼 **AI Orchestration** - Conduct multiple specialized AIs (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Cursor) instead of relying on one
- 🗺️ **Personalized Learning Paths** - Generate custom roadmaps tailored to your exact background and goals
- 🏗️ **Systems Thinking** - Understand complete systems, architecture, and how pieces connect
- ⚡ **Build While Learning** - Real projects, not just tutorials

**Timeline:** Varies by background and goals. Some see results in weeks, others need months. Your mileage will vary.

## 🎼 The Core Philosophy: AI Orchestration

**Traditional Approach (Inefficient):**
```
You → ChatGPT → Try to solve everything
         ↓
    Mediocre results
```

**Orchestration Approach (Optimal):**
```
You (Conductor) → Perplexity (Research)
                → Claude Chat (Strategy)
                → Cursor (Implementation)
                → Claude Code (Analysis)
                ↓
    Excellence in each domain
```

### The Three Laws of AI Orchestration
1. **Law of Specialization** - Never ask an AI to do what another AI does better
2. **Law of Context Transfer** - You carry context between AIs, not the AIs themselves
3. **Law of Clear Boundaries** - Each AI gets a specific job, not a vague mission

---

## 🚀 The 3-Prompt System

### 1. Learning Roadmap Generator
**When:** Starting new skills, career transitions, feeling lost
**AI:** Perplexity or Claude Chat
**Output:** Custom structured learning roadmap

### 2. Tech Stack Analysis
**When:** New project, inherited codebase, "WTF is this?"
**AI:** Claude Code or Claude Chat
**Output:** Architecture breakdown, data flow, learning priorities

### 3. Senior-Junior AI Pattern
**When:** Building anything, debugging, code review
**AI:** Claude Chat (Senior) + Cursor (Junior)
**Output:** Structured collaboration with escalation when stuck

---
