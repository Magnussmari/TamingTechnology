## 🔧 AI Tool Specialization

| AI Tool | Game Dev Use Case |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Claude Chat** | Game design patterns, state machines, AI behavior design |
| **Cursor** | Script generation (C#, C++, GDScript), gameplay logic |
| **Perplexity** | Engine-specific best practices, shader techniques, asset pipelines |
| **ChatGPT** | Game dialogue, narrative design, quest systems |
| **Gemini** | Analyze game screenshots for UI/UX feedback |

## 🎮 Game Dev Workflow Pattern

```
1. ChatGPT: Brainstorm game mechanics
2. Claude Chat: Design architecture (ECS? OOP? State machines?)
3. Perplexity: Research engine-specific implementations
4. Cursor: Implement gameplay scripts
5. Claude Chat: Review for performance bottlenecks
```
