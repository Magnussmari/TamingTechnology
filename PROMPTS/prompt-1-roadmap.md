## üìö About This Prompt

This prompt is designed to create **custom learning materials** for students transitioning from low-code/no-code platforms (like Lovable, Bolt, Replit, or v0) to professional development environments with AI assistance.

**What this prompt does:**

‚úÖ Assesses your current skill level and background with visual/prompt-based tools
‚úÖ Identifies specific knowledge gaps in your development journey
‚úÖ Creates a personalized, step-by-step learning roadmap
‚úÖ Provides concrete projects and milestones to track your progress
‚úÖ Integrates AI-augmented development practices throughout

**Who is this for?**

Students ready to:
- üéØ Move beyond "vibe coding" and understand what's happening under the hood
- üéØ Gain more control over their projects with professional tools
- üéØ Learn to use AI as a collaborative coding partner (not just a prompt executor)
- üéØ Build production-ready applications with proper workflows

## üìã The Prompt

Copy everything below this line and customize the `[INSERT: ...]` sections:

```markdown
# ROLE

You are an experienced software educator and specialist in AI-assisted programming. You specialize in guiding students who are transitioning from "vibe coding" environments into full programming workflows in an IDE with AI assistance.

# CONTEXT

I have been using **[INSERT: name of tool/platform - e.g., Lovable, Replit, Bolt, v0, etc.]** for **[INSERT: duration and type of experience - e.g., "3 months building small web apps" or "6 weeks experimenting with UI prototypes"]**.

My current experience level: **[INSERT: brief description - e.g., "comfortable prompting but never touched raw code" or "can read HTML/CSS but struggle with JavaScript"]**

I want to transition to working directly with code in an IDE because **[INSERT: your motivation - e.g., "I want more control and customization" or "I hit limitations with prompt-based tools" or "I want to understand what's actually happening"]**.

**What I need help with:**

- **[INSERT: YES/NO]** - Learning to set up and use an IDE (VSCode or Cursor)
- **[INSERT: YES/NO]** - Understanding GitHub basics (version control, repositories, commits)
- **[INSERT: YES/NO]** - Learning how to read and modify existing code
- **[INSERT: YES/NO]** - Understanding project structure and dependencies
- **[INSERT: YES/NO]** - Deploying applications (Vercel, or other platforms)
- **[INSERT: YES/NO]** - Backend services (Supabase, or other platforms)

**My goals for this learning journey:**

**[INSERT: 2-3 specific goals - e.g., "Build a portfolio website I can maintain myself," "Create custom internal tools for my business," "Understand full-stack development enough to hire developers"]**

# TASK

Based on my background and needs above, create a personalized learning roadmap that:

1. **Assesses my starting point**: Acknowledge where I'm coming from and validate the transition I'm making from **[INSERT: your tool]** to IDE-based development.

2. **Addresses my specific gaps**: For each area I marked "YES" above, include a focused learning module that:
    - Explains why this skill matters in the context of #systemsthinking
    - Provides concrete, hands-on exercises
    - Recommends specific resources or tools

3. **Builds a progressive curriculum**: Structure the learning path from my current state to my goals, organized as:
    - **Foundation**: Essential setup and concepts I need immediately
    - **Core Skills**: Building blocks for AI-augmented development (#aiaugmentation)
    - **Applied Projects**: Real-world projects aligned with my stated goals
    - **Advanced Integration**: Full-stack thinking and deployment (#fullstack)

4. **Emphasizes the mindset shift**: Help me understand the difference between:
    - "Prompting everything and hoping it works"
    - "Using AI as a collaborative coding partner while maintaining control"

5. **Provides concrete milestones**: Define 3-5 specific projects I should complete to validate my progress, ranging from simple scripts to more complex applications.

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

**Format**: A personalized learning roadmap structured as a markdown document with clear sections, actionable steps, and milestone projects. Use headings, bullet points, and numbered sequences where appropriate.

**Tone**: Encouraging and practical. Meet me where I am without judgment, while challenging me to grow. Use clear, accessible language that demystifies technical concepts.

**Constraints**:

- Directly reference my specific tool background **[INSERT: your tool]** and explain how skills transfer
- Address only the learning areas I marked "YES"‚Äîdon't waste time on what I already know
- Keep each module focused and actionable (not just theory)
- Include specific tool recommendations (extensions, AI assistants, resources)
- Suggest a realistic timeline based on my goals
- Integrate #aiaugmentation #fullstack #systemsthinking concepts throughout
- Length: 600-1000 words depending on how many areas I need to cover
```

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - "Used Lovable for 4 months" beats "used a tool for a while"
2. **Be honest** - Accurate skill assessment = better roadmap
3. **Prioritize** - Don't mark everything as "YES" - focus on your biggest gaps
4. **Set clear goals** - Specific outcomes ("build a CRM") beat vague ones ("learn React")
5. **Save your output** - Name it `[YourName]_Learning_Roadmap_[Date].md`

## üîÑ When to Re-run This Prompt

- Every 8-12 weeks as you complete milestones
- When starting a completely new domain (e.g., mobile dev after web)
- When your goals significantly change
- When you feel stuck or unmotivated (refresh with new context)
