## 🎯 Domain Adaptation Template

If you're creating a domain adaptation, use this structure:

```markdown
# [Domain Name] Adaptation

## Overview
Brief description of how AI orchestration applies to this domain

## Prompt 1 Modifications (Learning Roadmap)
- What to change in the learning roadmap prompt
- Domain-specific skills to add
- Example filled-out prompt

## Prompt 2 Modifications (Tech Stack Analysis)
- What to analyze in this domain
- Key technologies to focus on
- Example stack breakdown

## Prompt 3 Modifications (Senior-Junior Pattern)
- How escalation works in this domain
- Domain-specific report fields
- Example workflow

## AI Tool Specialization

## 🔄 Tool Update Protocol

When updating the AI Tool Matrix:

1. **Test the tool** - Use it for real work, not just demos
2. **Compare to existing tools** - Where does it excel? Where does it fall short?
3. **Update the CSV** - Add new row or update existing
4. **Update the guide** - Reference the tool in relevant sections
5. **Document your findings** - Add a note about why this update was made
