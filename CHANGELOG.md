#### Tool Recommendations
- Claude as primary coding assistant (up from equal status with others)
- ChatGPT positioned for learning support with memory feature
- Gemini added for massive document analysis
- Windsurf highlighted as beginner-friendly alternative to Cursor
- Research tools repositioned by specific use case (not generic recommendations)

#### Philosophy Updates
- Stronger emphasis on maintaining independent skills while using AI
- Added "perception-reality gap" awareness (developers think faster but may be slower)
- Context-dependent effectiveness explicitly addressed
- Security-first mindset for all AI-generated code

### Research Validation
